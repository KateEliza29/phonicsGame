# Phonics Game
kateeliza29.github.io/phonicsGame

## Introduction
Created in December 2019, this is a simple phonics game aimed at helping children to learn the 'ch' sound. 

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Scope and Improvements
On clicking the start button, the programme displays a number of buttons with words on. The words are pulled from a array of words with 'ch' in them, and an array of words without 'ch' in the them. 
When the correct word is pressed, the buttons move and are filled with new words, and the score counter increases. 
When an incorrect word is pressed, the button shows red.
If I were to take this project further I would do the following: 
* Amend the button move function to ensure that there is no overlap of buttons with other elements on the page.
* Allow the user to select which phoneme they would like to play the game with. 
* Develop a json filled with all sounds and words which could be called in, rather than using individual arrays.
